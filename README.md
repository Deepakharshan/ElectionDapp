# ElectionDapp

1.In this project I wrote a simple Dapp (Decentralized Application) and It is based on  Election concept.
2.ELection Dapp is written in React.js in front-end and solidity in Back-end. And i use ethers.js in order to  interact with smart contract. You can also use web3.js instead of ethers.js 
3.Im used kovan testnet for contract deployement.

(If you findout any bug related to this project .I request you to kindle inform me).
