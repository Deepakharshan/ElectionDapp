# ElectionDapp
In this project I wrote a simple Dapp (Decentralized Application) and It is based on  Election concept.

ELection Dapp is written in React.js in front-end and solidity in Back-end. And i use ethers.js in order to  interact with smart contract. You can also use web3.js instead of ethers.js
